# Collections

Collections are how Insight organizes your documents. Think of them as folders—each collection holds a set of related documents with its own search and sharing settings.

## Creating a Collection

Click **New Collection** and give it a name. You might organize by:

- Investigation (e.g., "City Hall Contracts")
- Beat (e.g., "Climate", "Housing")
- Source type (e.g., "Court Documents", "FOIA Responses")

## Adding Documents

Drag and drop PDF files into a collection, or click **Add Files**.

When you add a document, Insight:

1. Extracts the text so the AI can read it
2. Prepares it for searching
3. Stores everything locally on your computer

## Sharing with Colleagues

You can share collections directly with other Insight users—no cloud upload required.

### To Share

1. Open the collection
2. Click **Share**
3. Send the generated link to your colleague

### To Join

1. Click **Join Collection**
2. Paste the link you received
3. Documents will copy to your computer automatically

Once synced, you both have full copies. You can work offline and still access everything.
