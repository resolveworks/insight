Insight uses AI to help you find and understand information in your documents. Just ask questions in plain language—the AI does the searching for you.

## How It Works

When you ask a question:

1. The AI figures out what you're looking for
2. It searches your documents to find relevant passages
3. It reads through what it finds
4. It gives you an answer with citations

You don't need to know which document contains the answer. Just ask, and the AI will find it.

## Example Questions

**Finding facts:**

- "What was the total budget for 2023?"
- "Who approved the permit?"
- "When did the meeting take place?"

**Summarizing:**

- "Summarize the key findings from these reports"
- "What are the main arguments in this brief?"

**Comparing:**

- "How do the 2020 and 2023 assessments differ?"
- "Find contradictions between these statements"

**Exploring:**

- "What topics are covered in this collection?"
- "Find all mentions of Company X"

## Citations

Every answer includes citations. Click one to jump straight to that passage in the original document—so you can verify and quote accurately.

## Model Options

### Cloud Models

Insight works with Anthropic (Claude) and OpenAI (GPT) models. Add your API key in settings to use them. This is the recommended option for most users—fast responses on any computer.

When using cloud models, your questions and the relevant document excerpts are sent to the provider. Your full documents stay on your computer.

### Local Models

You can also run AI models entirely on your machine. This keeps everything private but requires a powerful computer with a dedicated GPU (NVIDIA or Apple Silicon) for comfortable use. On a typical laptop, expect slower responses.
