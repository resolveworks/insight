# Insight

An AI research assistant for journalists. Your documents stay on your computer.

## Why Insight?

Newsrooms deal with mountains of documents—court filings, FOIA responses, leaked files—but searching and analyzing them usually means uploading to cloud services you may not trust.

Insight is different. Your documents are processed and stored locally—they never leave your computer unless you choose to share them with a colleague. You can run the AI entirely on your machine, or use cloud models (Anthropic, OpenAI) for the chat while keeping your documents local.

## What Can It Do?

- **Answer questions about your documents** — Ask in plain language, get answers with citations pointing to the exact source.
- **Search smarter** — Finds relevant content even when you don't know the exact words to search for.
- **Share securely** — Send collections directly to colleagues, laptop-to-laptop, without a server in between.
- **Work offline** — Once set up, no internet needed.
